                <p>Hi, I'm Noah. I'm a fourth year student at Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I'm really interested in web, graphic, UI, and product design, as well as full stack development and software engineering in general. My dream is to create the next big thing in technology, and make an impact by helping people along the way.</p>
                <p>I've worked on a bunch of cool projects during my time at college (check out my resume <a href="resume.pdf">here</a>), and in my spare time I lead a development team for <a href="http://calblueprint.org">Cal Blueprint</a> and play bass drum for the <a href="http://calband.berkeley.edu">Cal Marching Band</a>. You can see what I've been working on recently on the <a class="js-section-link" data-section="projects" href="#">projects page</a>.</p>
                <p>I'm also into writing blog posts about a LOT of things: you can read there <a href="blog/">here</a>.</p>

                        <div class="description">Berkeleytime is a Django based web application which makes course discovery for UC Berkeley students simple. The app includes four sections: a catalog that allows students to search classes easily and filter by university academic requirements, a grade distributions page which allows students to compare grade distributions across multiple classes, semesters, or professors, an enrollment tracking page for figuring out how fast classes fill up during registration, and a campus page for determining what rooms are available when on campus. Since launching in 2012, the site has accured more almost 100,000 unique visitors and almost a million page views. It's deployed on heroku with a postgres backend, and the frontend uses jQuery and AJAX extensively to dynamically load course, grade, enrollment, and campus data.</div>

                        <div class="description">I interned at Yelp during the summer of 2013. Among many small enhancements to the backend and frontend of Yelp's website (desktop and mobile), I implemented a new UI for search suggestions on m.yelp.com: the UI provides algorithmically curated category and business suggestions based on the user's query, which then allow navigation directly to the category or business page (in addition to regular search suggestions, which are based on common searches).</div>
