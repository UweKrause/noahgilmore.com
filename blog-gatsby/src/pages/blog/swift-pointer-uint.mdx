title: Casting a pointer to UInt in Swift

  There are some times in Swift, like when using [System Trace](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/411/), that you want to get the pointer value of an object directly as a `UInt` (passing the pointer to `kdebug_signpost` is one). I was surprised at how hard it was to find documentation on how to get a Swift reference’s pointer value as a `UInt`.

There are some times in Swift, like when using [System Trace](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/411/), that you want to get the pointer value of an object directly as a `UInt` (passing the pointer to `kdebug_signpost` is one). I was surprised at how hard it was to find documentation on how to get a Swift reference’s pointer value as a `UInt`. Here’s how to do it, using the `UInt(bitPattern:)` initializer:

```swift
_ = withUnsafePointer(to: myObject) { unsafePointer in
    let pointerValue = UInt(bitPattern: unsafePointer)
    // do whatever with pointerValue: it's a UInt!
}
```
