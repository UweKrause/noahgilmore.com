I've been working lately on rewriting some of [CIFilter.io](/blog/cifilterio) in SwiftUI. One crash I came across that initially stumped me would happen when resetting my `UIHostingController`'s `rootView` to a view that was equivalent to the one already set (mostly, this happened when transitioning the window from full to split-screen mode). The crash only had one stackframe that started with `AG::LayoutDescriptor::compare`:

```
#0	0x00007fff4a9b6069 in AG::LayoutDescriptor::compare(unsigned char const*, unsigned char const*, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int) ()
```

Initially I had no idea what was going on here, but I found two clues. One was this tweet:

<Tweet tweetId="1268846742558179330" />

Looks like [Alexey Demedeckiy](https://medium.com/@DAloG) ran into this a while back, and the solution was to make an enum with many cases conform to `Equatable`. I realized that I also had an enum (`FilterParameterType`) with 20+ cases which I was now using as part of the SwiftUI view state.

The second clue was that the crashing method was called `compare`: my enum wasn't equatable, but it seems like SwiftUI was doing something under the hood to try to compare it anyways.

I spent a bit of time creating a sample project and whitling down my code into a minimal reproduction case, and I realized that the following triggers the same crash:

```swift
enum Type {
    case one(info: String)
    case two(info: String)
    case three(info: String)
    case four(info: String)
    case five(info: String)
    case six(info: String)
    case seven(info: String)
    case eight(info: String)
    case nine(info: String)
    case ten(info: String)
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var type: Type = .one(info: "one")

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Button(action: {
                self.type = .one(info: "one")
            }, label: {
                Text("Tap here to crash")
            })
        }
    }
}
```

Tapping that button (twice, for some reason?) crashes the app!

This was a super, super interesting bug to find. Even more interesting is that the crash _doesn't_ happen if you do any of the following:

1. Make the enum `Equatable`
2. Comment out one of the cases
3. Comment out the _associated value_ of one of the cases

From what I can tell, SwiftUI's trying hard to compare the enum, even if it's not equatable, but I guess 10 cases is the point at which it gives up.

The takeaway: if you use enums as part of your SwiftUI view state, make them Equatable.
