A problem that many people run into after writing enough SwiftUI is how to make it so that two views inside an `HStack` have equal width, such that if the `HStack` grows both inner views expand proportionally.

There are several articles online talking about how to do this with `GeometryReader` or preferences, but for the common case of just having columns equally distributed, it's actually easier to just use frames. If you set the views' frames to both have a min width of 0 and max width of infinity, SwiftUI's layout system distributes them equally:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        HStack(alignment: .top, spacing: 0) {
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.blue)
                .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity)
            Rectangle()
                .fill(Color.red)
                .frame(minWidth: 0, maxWidth: .infinity)
        }.padding().background(Color.white)
    }
}
```

This produces the result we want regardless of screen size:

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="swiftui-columns-small.png" alt="Red and blue squares filling space equally on a small screen" caption="" />
    <CaptionedImage max={500} filename="swiftui-columns-large.png" alt="Red and blue squares filling space equally on a large screen" caption="" />
</FlowGrid>

Hopefully this helps you simplify your SwiftUI code for when you only need to account for the common case of two columns 👍
