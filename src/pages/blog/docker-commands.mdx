I'm a Docker noob, and for whatever reason, I can never remember the best way to do things with Docker, whether it's checking which containers are running or starting/stopping them. Putting some common commands here mostly for personal reference.

List containers:

```
docker ps -a
```

Check container status:

```
docker inspect ID | jq .[0].State
```

Start container:

```
docker container start ID
```
