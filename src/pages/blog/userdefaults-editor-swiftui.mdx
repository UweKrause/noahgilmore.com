I've been talking a lot (TODO tweet embed) online about how useful SwiftUI has been in building debug components for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io?utm_source=noahgilmore.com&utm_campaign=userdefaultseditor&utm_content=1) - debug menus are one of the places where you can start using SwiftUI right now (TODO link to rambo's post), and I've found that since writing little UIs is easier with SwiftUI, I've been able to create a lot more developer tools for myself, _during the actual development_ of the app.

I thought I'd highlight in this post one of the debug tools I developed for editing the app's known UserDefaults on the fly, since I found it to be especially nice and elegant when combined with modern Swift components like property wrappers, keypaths, and bindings.

The UI we're building is doesn't have a lot of components: each boolean user default gets a toggle, and when you tap the toggle, the user default gets persisted:

# UserDefaults with property wrappers

A lot has been written about TODO links writing your app's UserDefaults as a global object with property wrappers - in fact, I think it's one of the few cases I've come across where property wrappers make a lot of sense to use over other methods. The [Fluency](https://getfluency.io?utm_source=noahgilmore.com&utm_campaign=userdefaultseditor&utm_content=2) property wrapper looks like this:

```swift
@propertyWrapper
struct SimpleUserDefault<T> {
    let userDefaults: UserDefaults
    let key: String
    let defaultValue: T

    init(
        userDefaults: UserDefaults = UserDefaults.standard,
        key: String,
        defaultValue: T
    ) {
        self.userDefaults = userDefaults
        self.key = key
        self.defaultValue = defaultValue
    }

    var wrappedValue: T {
        get {
            guard let data = userDefaults.object(forKey: key) as? T else { return self.defaultValue }
            return data
        }

        set {
            userDefaults.set(newValue, forKey: key)
        }
    }
}
```

I've found this implementation works well for native values like bools (if you want more complicated encoding/decoding, your mileage may vary). The next step is to create a global object (I call mine `UserDefaultsConfig`) which wraps the defaults. Let's assume that we have two defaults: one to enable debug mode in our app, and one to hide a new UI we don't want released yet:

```swift
class UserDefaultsConfig {
    static let shared = UserDefaultsConfig()

    @SimpleUserDefault(key: "com.getfluencyio.is-test-mode-enabled", defaultValue: false)
    var testModeEnabled: Bool

    @SimpleUserDefault(key: "com.getfluencyio.is-new-ui-enabled", defaultValue: false)
    var newUIEnabled: Bool
}
```

Wherever we want to check out defaults, we can use `if UserDefaultsConfig.shared.testModeEnabled { /*...*/ }` to determine the default's value. But the really interesting part is building a debug tool for ourselves which lets us edit each of these flags on the fly.

# Editing UI
For the editing UI in our debug menu, we'll write a quick SwiftUI view:

```swift
struct UserDefaultsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView(/* reference testModeEnabled here */)
            UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView(/* reference newUIEnabled here */)
        }.navigationBarTitle("UserDefaults Editor", displayMode: .inline)
    }
}
```

But the implementation of `UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView` isn't super straightforward. In fact, how to make this work in an elegant way has been confusing to more people than just me:

Let's break the problem into a simpler piece: how would we write this UI if UserDefaults wasn't involved? Probably we'd use a few `@State` properties and a `Toggle`:

```swift
struct UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView: View {
    @State var isOn: Bool = false
    let name: String

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Toggle(isOn: self.$isOn) {
                Text(name)
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

Since `Toggle` takes a `Binding`, we'll have to find a way to access the properties of our `UserDefautlsConfig` using a `Binding`. We could go the brute force method: write `get` and `set` functions for each property, and update our view to take a binding:

```swift
let testModeEnabledBinding = Binding(get: {
    UserDefaultsConfig.shared.testModeEnabled
}, set: {
    UserDefaultsConfig.shared.testModeEnabled = $0
})

struct UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView: View {
    let binding: Binding<Bool>
    let name: String

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Toggle(isOn: self.binding) {
                Text(name)
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

This will work, but it's a lot of code to type out for every single property you want to edit. One step further would be to use key paths to create the binding:

```swift
extension Binding {
    init<RootType>(keyPath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<RootType, Value>, object: RootType) {
        self.init(
            get: { object[keyPath: keyPath] },
            set: { object[keyPath: keyPath] = $0}
        )
    }
}

let testModeEnabledBinding = Binding(keyPath: \.testModeEnabled, object: UserDefaultsConfig.shared)

struct UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView: View {
    let binding: Binding<Bool>
    let name: String

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Toggle(isOn: self.binding) {
                Text(name)
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

We've reduced the boilerplate for each binding, but we still have to write out a new one for every user default we want to edit. As I was working with this, I realized a better way would be to _make the UserDefaultsConfig object observerable itself!_ If we conform our config to ObservableObject, then we can have every toggle item observe one of its keypaths, which ends up looking quite nice:

```swift
class UserDefaultsConfig: ObservableObject {
    static let shared = UserDefaultsConfig()

    let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()

    @SimpleUserDefault(key: "com.getfluencyio.is-test-mode-enabled", defaultValue: false)
    var testModeEnabled: Bool {
        willSet {
            objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }

    @SimpleUserDefault(key: "com.getfluencyio.is-new-ui-enabled", defaultValue: false)
    var newUIEnabled: Bool {
        willSet {
            objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }
}
```

Since these properties aren't `@Published`, we need to inform SwiftUI that the object should change any time one of them is updated, which is why we call `objectWillChange.send()` on every `willSet`. However, this makes it really easy to write the editor view, which is the finished product that I used for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io?utm_source=noahgilmore.com&utm_campaign=userdefaultseditor&utm_content=3):

```swift
struct UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView: View {
    @ObservedObject var defaultsConfig = UserDefaultsConfig.shared
    let path: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<UserDefaultsConfig, Bool>
    let name: String

    var body: some View {
        HStack {
            Toggle(isOn: Binding(keyPath: self.path, object: self.defaultsConfig)) {
                Text(name)
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}

struct UserDefaultsView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView(path: \.testModeEnabled, name: "Test Mode")
            UserDefaultsConfigToggleItemView(path: \.newUIEnabled, name: "Hide Test Mode UI")
        }.navigationBarTitle("UserDefaults Editor", displayMode: .inline)
    }
}
```

Here's what the sample app which implements this looks like - it's still surprising to me that SwiftUI enables creating nontrivial UIs like this in so few lines of code:

## Conclusion
I think this ends up being a simple, expressive interface that allows for toggling all your UserDefaults flags in a debug menu view pretty easily. Property wrappers and key paths definitely make Swift more complicated, but they end up enabling really nice syntactic sugar like this, which I love as a developer because I get to spend less time writing boilerplate and more time focusing on the business logic of the apps I write.

Note: it might be possible to go even further with this approach: as of Swift 5.2, it should be technically possible to nest property wrappers, so there might be a way to make `@Published` work with `@SimpleUserDefault`. I haven't been able to make this work in practice without the Swift compiler segfaulting (Xcode 11.4.1) but if you figure out a way, please [let me know](https://twitter.com/noahsark769).

I'm hoping to write more about SwiftUI and how it enables easier app development in the future! You can [follow me on Twitter for updates](https://twitter.com/noahsark769) ðŸ‘‹
