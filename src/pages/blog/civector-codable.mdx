For my current [side project](https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1102318232025718785), I have to export CIFilter parameters to json, and I've been running into issues with various CoreImage types not conforming to Swift's `Codable`. `CIColor` works well with `Codable` out of the box, but `CIVector` (which represents an arbitrary length list of `CGFloats`) is trickier.

Thought I'd share a wrapper type which I use to encode and decode `CIVector`:

```swift
struct CIVectorCodableWrapper {
    let vector: CIVector
}

extension CIVectorCodableWrapper: Codable {
    public init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        var container = try decoder.unkeyedContainer()
        var floats: [CGFloat] = []
        while !container.isAtEnd {
            floats.append(try container.decode(CGFloat.self))
        }
        vector = CIVector(floats: floats)
    }

    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.unkeyedContainer()
        for i in 0..<vector.count {
            try container.encode(vector.value(at: i))
        }
    }
}
```

`CIVector` is semantically an "unkeyed container" type, so the `Codable` implementation encodes the vector's floats to an unkeyed coding container (with `JSONEncoder`, for example, this becomes an array).
