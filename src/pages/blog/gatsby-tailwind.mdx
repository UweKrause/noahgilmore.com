    When creating the site for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io), I figured now was as good a time as any to try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Like all static sites I build nowadays, the site runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but wnfortunately the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/) on how to integrate Tailwind with Gatsby are quite complicated...

When creating the site for [Fluency](https://getfluency.io), I figured now was as good a time as any to try out [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Like all static sites I build nowadays, the site runs on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), but unfortunately the [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/tailwind-css/) on how to integrate Tailwind with Gatsby are quite complicated. As someone who isn't super familiar with the current state of web build systems, PostCSS, etc, it took me longer than I thought to figure out how to integrate it.

So, this is what I know as the minimal number of steps to start using Tailwind classes to style your CSS in a Gatsby site:

1. Install packages:
    ```
    npm install tailwindcss --save-dev
    npm install --save gatsby-plugin-postcss
    ```
2. Add plugin to your `gatsby-config.js`, so that Gatsby knows to load postcss (which loads Tailwind):
    ```js
    plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
    ```
3. Add the following to a new file at the root of the repo called `postcss.config.js` so that postcss knows to load Tailwind:
    ```js
    module.exports = () => ({
      plugins: [require("tailwindcss")],
    })
    ```
4. Create a new css file with the following content (the directives here apply Tailwind styles) - I called mine `global.css`:
    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```
5. Add the following to `gatsby-browser.js`, so that Gatsby imports Tailwind on every page:
    ```js
    import "./src/global.css";
    ```

Voila, you should now be able to use Tailwind classes anywhere to style your site.

## Bonus
If you happen to use the Tailwind CSS Itellisense plugin for VS Code, which will autocomplete Tailwind CSS classes, there's an [issue](https://github.com/bradlc/vscode-tailwindcss/issues/74) open indicating that a Tailwind config is required. In order to make this work, you'll need to run
```
npx tailwind init
```
