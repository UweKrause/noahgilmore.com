UIKit is the kind of framework which has a lot of subtleties that you don't run into unless you've been using UIKit for a long time. At work, we do a fair amount of presenting view controllers as popovers to add context or more data to our existing iPad view. A common flow is the following:

1. Present a small popover to add more context to something the user tapped
2. When the user taps on a button in that popover, push on a new view controller with more information

Seems easy enough, but the kicker is when _the two view controllers are different sizes_. Surprisingly, this is tricky to implement in UIKit. In this post we're going to discuss how to use UINavigationController to make a flow that looks like this:

<CaptionedImage max={400} filename="popover-finished.gif" alt="Finished presentation of UIViewControllers with different content sizes inside a popover" caption="" />
