Talk about the rules I follow when using twitter, focusing on interaction with people.

- If you post an image of code post a gist also. If you post a short gist post an image also.
- Stance on tweeting politics
- Blame the process not the person
- Misinformation and mob mentality
- Apologizing for deleting tweets
- Avoid blanket statements, only tweet about groups of people when a representative of that group has started the conversation (need to work this out more)
