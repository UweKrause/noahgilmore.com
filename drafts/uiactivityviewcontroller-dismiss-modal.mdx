Talk about how to get around the issue where UIActivityViewController dismisses whatever controller is modally presented.

```
let intermediaryController = UIViewController()
                    intermediaryController.modalPresentationStyle = .overFullScreen

                    activityController.completionWithItemsHandler = { [weak newController] _, _, _, _ in
                        intermediaryController.dismiss(animated: false, completion: nil)
                    }
```
