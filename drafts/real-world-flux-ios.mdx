Talk about flux in the real world

Implementing stores/dispatchers/actions

What to do:
- Works great with table views
- What should subscribe for arbitrarily nested views? Should the subview subscribe, or should the superview do it and pass data down?
- What about actions that modify global state not encapsulated in the state? E.g. saving an image to disk?
- What about actions that have a delayed effect? What about actions that have an effect that takes place on another thread?
