The reasons why I think interface builder shouldn't be used. Some things from https://gist.github.com/iraycd/01b45c5e1be7ef6957b7, but also from my own experience

- Hard to tell which constraints will get applied in different device sizes, etc
- No global constants, you just have to type in the number each time
- Can't search for greaterThanOrEqualTo constraints (or constraints by type in general)
- Can't search at all (e.g. look for the view that has a certain color, like finding one that's hardcoding to `white`)
