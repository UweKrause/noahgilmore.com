Funnily enough, the main feature of the app which people seem to use today (overlaying built-in icons on the \"transparent\" images) wasn’t included at all.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I think the necessity of getting the app out fast to \"capitalize on the trend\" meant that I didn’t fall into the hole of wanting to add more and more little features before launch (one I’ve fallen into many times).

Whether it’s 2 days, 2 weeks, or 2 months, what’s important is recognizing what you can do to provide the minimum value and getting something out the door.`}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"releasing-iterating-and-marketing\"\n    }}>{`Releasing, Iterating, and Marketing`}</h1>\n    <p>{`By the time the app was released, I had drummed up a tiny bit of following from the Twitter thread, but not nearly enough to get it in front of the audience that I wanted. So while implementing \"fast follow\" features like overlying logos on the transparent icons, I started to think about marketing. I’m no social media marketer, but here are a few things I tried and how well they worked:`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Twitter`}</strong>{`: I started by creating a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1310059780875022337?s=20\"\n      }}>{`thread`}</a>{` detailing how to use the app to create transparent icons, in the style of the original thread which I got the idea from. Then, my approach was to search Twitter for keywords like \"transparent icons\" or \"clear icons\" multiple times a day, and when I found someone asking about transparent iOS app icons I'd link them to the thread. The thread didn’t take off as much as I hoped it would, but I was definitely able to get some initial traction this way.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Instagram`}</strong>{`: I made an `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://instagram.com/transparentappicons\"\n      }}>{`Instagram account`}</a>{` for the app and started basically liking and following any account which posted iOS 14 related hashtags. It’s hard to know how much this worked, but it wasn’t ineffective, at least - around 100 people started following the account, and the posts (screenshots, in-development features, or Home Screen setups I created just to have content to post) got likes and comments, and some people reported bugs by messaging the app account.`}</p>\n    <p>{`I had the idea of identifying high-follower accounts who were posting about iOS 14, creating promotional Home Screens which matched their aesthetic, and tagging them in my Story with the hope they’d repost and boost my reach. This happened a few times, but unfortunately it didn’t result in more engagement with the account’s content or downloads. I guess people just swipe through these stories - it probably would have been better to reach out to these creators and offer them promo codes directly. According to App Store Connect analytics, the App Store link in the Instagram account’s bio has only accounted for something like 20 sales over the app’s lifetime, so it was overall only effective as a communication platform.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Reddit`}</strong>{`: There were various subreddits where people were posting about iOS 14, which I found through Reddit searches - `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSsetups/\"\n      }}>{`r/iossetups`}</a>{` was the biggest one. I took the approach of trawling through the comments, finding people talking about transparent icons, and linking them to the app. I also posted the promotional screens I made there, and at least one post got 600+ upvotes and 50+ comments, and resulted in a small bump in downloads. The best thing I got from reading Reddit comments was information on the competition, though - more on that later.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Youtube`}</strong>{`: This is where I was actually able to hit the mark well. There were a ton of videos talking about iOS 14 customization, which you could find easily by searching for things like \"clear app icons.\" I’d comment on these videos telling folks that they might be interested in the app, then message the creators privately (via email or Instagram, or whatever platform they said they were available on) and tell them about the app with a promo code.`}</p>\n    <CaptionedImage max={400} filename=\"tai-conversation.png\" alt=\"Instagram sceenshot of a message. The message says: Hey <redacted>! I'm Noah, the developer behind the Transparent Icons app (this account). I loved your video on Clear Spaces! I just thought I would reach out because my app does a similar thing, but with app icons instead of widgets - it's a bit tougher to create clear spaces on your Home Screen, but it's also more flexible and it doesn't need TestFlight (Clear Spaces won't be approved for the App Store because Apple doesn't allow apps to have empty names). Here's a promo code to check out Transparent App Icons if you like: <redacted>. And here's a link to the app:\" caption=\"\" mdxType=\"CaptionedImage\" />\n    <p>{`I think this ended up working because it was a win-win - these creators found out about content their audiences cared about, and the app got more publicity.

That seemed to be enough of an activation energy to get the ball rolling - shortly after this I started realizing that marketing was taking up a ton of my time, and I had to ramp it down, but downloads stayed relatively constant around 40-50 a day.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This also provided the trampoline to have further interactions on Twitter - people messaging about the app, promo code giveaways on smaller accounts, getting connected with the developers of similar apps, etc. The promo code giveaways (`}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://twitter.com/Bo0MH4CKS/status/1318949265020944388\"\n      }}>{`like this one`}</a>{`) were an interesting marketing mechanism - sometimes they worked and sometimes they didn’t, but at best I traded 5 free downloads (via promo code) for 20+ paid ones.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The strategy wasn’t unique to YouTubers either: I reached out to the author of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/26/transparent-iphone-widgets-ios-14/\"\n      }}>{`this article`}</a>{` on 9to5Mac, since the article was about `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.clearspaces.app/\"\n      }}>{`Clear Spaces`}</a>{`, which had a similar audience. They added a link to my app there as well, which resulted in a big download bump.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Lastly, I got in contact with the developers of `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.clearspaces.app/\"\n      }}>{`Clear Spaces`}</a>{` and `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"\"\n      }}>{`Iconboard`}</a>{` (two popular apps in the same product space), and we agreed that it would be mutually beneficial to cross-link the apps - both apps now have a link to Transparent App Icons under their settings menus, and I link back. I got this idea because I follow the developers and they’re doing great work, but I wasn’t sure what effect it would have on downloads - turns out that these two app referrers accounted for 22% of Transparent App Icons units last month!`}</p>\n    <p>{`I think the takeaway here is that you have to try everything and figure out what works best for your niche. I was lucky that I eventually stumbled onto the idea of promoting the app directly to content creators, but that won’t work for every app - try a bunch of stuff, including things very specific to your app’s context, and see what sticks.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"competitors-and-related-apps\"\n    }}>{`Competitors and Related Apps`}</h1>\n    <p>{`I realized during the post-release period that there were other ways to create transparent icons. iEmpty and Makeovr have websites that do very similar things, and there’s a Shortcut floating around which does most of what Transparent App Icons does. There were downsides to each, though: iEmpty has a ton of ads, Makeovr hasn’t been updated for new phones, and the Shortcut isn’t discoverable and is harder to use than an app. There was also an App Store copycat which got eventually removed, but that’s a story for another time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My strategy when people would post links to these competitors was just to ignore them and focus on my bet that having the convenience of an app with full support for all devices and a responsive customer support contact (me) would be worth the 99c paid-up-front price of the app. All the while, I knew none of the competitors had functionality to overlay common logos over the transparent icons, and I knew this is what a lot of users wanted (since I had launched early and had people reaching out to support via email). So while I was marketing, I was also iterating on the app by adding overlay functionality.`}</p>\n    <p>{`My point is: if you have an idea which you think might be good for an app, don’t discount it just because another solution exists. Try out the competition, see if it solves the problem, and see if there’s space for your idea - in this case, the presence of competitors didn’t preclude the success of Transparent App Icons.`}</p>\n    <h1 {...{\n      \"id\": \"app-statistics-and-analytics\"\n    }}>{`App Statistics and Analytics`}</h1>\n    <p>{`Now let’s get down to the nitty gritty - here’s some transparency (hah) into Transparent App Icons’s numbers.

Other than that, downloads seem to have reached an equilibrium around 50 per day, which is really great considering that I’m doing almost no marketing for the app at all nowadays.
