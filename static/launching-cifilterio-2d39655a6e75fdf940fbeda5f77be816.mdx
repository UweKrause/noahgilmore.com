Today I'm launching [CIFilter.io](https://cifilter.io) ðŸŽ‰

CIFilter.io is a project I've been working on for the last few months, and today it's [open source](https://github.com/noahsark769/cifilter.io/). It has two parts:

1. A website, [https://cifilter.io](https://cifilter.io), which lists all the available [CIFilters](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifilter), their information and examples of applying them
2. [An app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cifilter-io/id1457458557?mt=8) which allows you to apply each CIFilter to various inputs, tune their parameters, and apply them to camera and photo library images

The website is completely free and I intend to keep it updated with each new release of iOS and macOS. The app is not free, but your purchase helps support this project and others like it, and you can build it [from source](https://github.com/noahsark769/cifilter.io/tree/master/iOS) if you'd prefer.

In this post I'll go into a bit of detail about the project, how it works, and why I built it.

# Background

[CIFilter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifilter) is a powerful part of [Core Image](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage) that every app developer can take advantage of. There are many (207, as of iOS 12) CIFilters available in Core Image - everything from doing image compositing to photobooth effects.

However, it's hard to find documentation on what filters are available or how they work. Apple has [a page](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CoreImageFilterReference/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004346) listing about 85% of the available filters, but it's "no longer being updated", and no new filters which were made available in iOS 10, 11, or 12 are listed there. If you Google `CIThermal`, for example, most of what you'll find is iOS header dumps.

For the filters which are listed, many have incomplete documentation: for example, the `inputSharpness` parameter to [CICheckerboardGenerator](https://cifilter.io#CICheckerboardGenerator) says:

> An NSNumber object whose attribute type is CIAttributeTypeScalar and whose display name is Sharpness.

Good info, but doesn't tell you what the parameter actually does. The examples on this page are also limited - for example, [CISourceOutCompositing](https://cifilter.io#CISourceOutCompositing) takes an `inputImgage` and a `backgroundImage`. The page shows two images being composited, but doesn't specify which image is which:

# Problem
I ran into this documentation issue at work (in fact, I recently gave [a talk](https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1111148213921153024) detailing more background on what issues I ran into), and I thought that there must be a better way. Turns out, it's possible to get info about every filter and their parameters by using `CIFilter`'s [attributes var](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage/cifilter/1437661-attributes).

The CIFilter.io [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cifilter-io/id1457458557?mt=8) takes this filter attributes data, parses and normalizes it, and renders it to a json (which you can view [here](https://github.com/noahsark769/cifilter.io/blob/master/web/src/data/filters.json)). The CIFilter.io [website](https://cifilter.io) parses this json and renders it using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

# The Website
The [CIFilter.io website](https://cifilter.io) lists all filters and allows searching through the list:

Each filter lists the description and parameters, pulled directly from the filter's `attributes` dict, which are generally more descriptive. For example, the `inputSharpness` parameter discussed above has the following description on CIFilter.io:

> The sharpness of the edges in pattern. The smaller the value, the more blurry the pattern. Values range from 0.0 to 1.0.

And the example for [CISourceOutCompositing](https://cifilter.io#CISourceOutCompositing) shows the input parameter names:

# The App
The [CIFilter.io app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cifilter-io/id1457458557?mt=8) also shows documentation for all filters, but allows you to interactively apply them as well. Here's a gif of applying [CICheckerboardGenerator](https://cifilter.io#CICheckerboardGenerator):
