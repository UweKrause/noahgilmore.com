I've been talking a fair amount recently about how I've been writing a lot of unit tests for [Fluency, my Confluence editor app](https://getfluency.io), and how much I value having good tests to catch regressions and verify that the editor is actually working correctly. In the case of Fluency, I now have 70+ tests which test various parts of the app, and I've extracted various utils out of the actual `XCTestCase`s into functions like `assertRoundTrip(xml:)`, which takes in [Confluence Storage Format](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html) XML, renders it to an `NSAttributedString`, reads it back, and asserts that the resulting xml is the same as what was passed in - a crucial test when you want to make sure your editor isn't going to break any page storage just by saving.

Today, I took the next step by writing some more complicated tests: I wanted to sample 100+ valid Confluence pages from various places on the web and `assertRoundTrip` on them, to give myself a reasonable amount of confidence that my editor could handle "real world" inputs. Some of these pages were quite large, and as a result the tests would take a long time to run, so I opted to put them in a separate test target so that I could run all the "unit" tests separately from the "integration" tests.

This all seemed fine, but I ran into a road block - `assertRoundTrip` had been declared in my original test target, so it wasn't available in the new one. After struggling for a few hours, I was finally  (with some help) able to figure out a way to extract my test utils into a shared library, but it wasn't at all straightforward. In this post I'll describe the method I used so that you can implement the same thing if it works for your project.

> The sample code for this article is available at [NGSharedTestUtilsTargetExample](https://github.com/noahsark769/NGSharedTestUtilsTargetExample). If you're just interested in a list of steps to create the shared library, skip to [here](/blog/xcode-shared-test-target#tldr).

## Background and Goal
Let's assume a fairly standard setup for iOS app development: we have an app called `ExampleApp`, and if we checked the "Include Unit Tests" checkbox when we created it in Xcode, we have a unit test target called `ExampleAppTests`. For purposes of example, let's say we have a container type in our app:

```swift
struct Container {
    let value1: String
    let value2: String
}
```

And in our tests, we've defined a util to test it (`assertContainerWorks` is less complicated than `assertRoundTrip`, but the same idea):

```swift
// ExampleAppTests.swift
import XCTest
@testable import ExampleApp

func assertContainerWorks() {
    let container = Container(value1: "abc", value2: "abc")
    XCTAssertEqual(container.value1, container.value2)
}

class ExampleAppTests: XCTestCase {
    func testExample() throws {
        assertContainerWorks()
    }
}
```

Now, we want to add another test target which uses the same util. Right-clicking ExampleAppTests in the text navigator and choosing "New Unit Test Target" gets us that target, which we can call `OtherTests`:

<CaptionedImage filename="xcodeshared-2.png" max={400} caption="" alt="Xcode UI with 'New Unit Test' menu item selected" />

Our `OtherTests.swift` looks like:

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import ExampleApp

class OtherTests: XCTestCase {
    func testExample() throws {
        assertContainerWorks()
    }
}
```

But the issue is that this doesn't compile, since `assertContainerWorks` is defined in `ExampleAppTests`, not `OtherTests`.

Our goal is to extract `assertContainerWorks` into a shared library (we'll call it `SharedTestUtils`) such that:

1. Both test targets should be able to import it and use `assertContainerWorks`
2. `SharedTestUtils` itself should be able to use types from `ExampleApp` (i.e. it should be able to `@testable import ExampleApp`)

## Creating a Static Library
> If you'd like to practice this part or compare it to your own local Xcode setup, [this commit](https://github.com/noahsark769/NGSharedTestUtilsTargetExample/commit/d8fb23b14168561000189a71533e79747ade16f3) is the starting point before the shared library has been created.

The way we'll approach this is to create `SharedTestUtils` as a static library (for more on why we need a static library as opposed to another kind of library, see the next section). The first step is to create the new target:

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-3.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'New Target' option selected" caption="New Target" />
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-4.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'Static Library' option selected" caption="Static library" />
</FlowGrid>

`SharedTestUtils.swift` gets created automatically - we can fill it in with our util (and since it's now in another module, it has to be `public`):

```swift
// SharedTestUtils.swift
import XCTest
@testable import ExampleApp

public func assertContainerWorks() {
    let container = Container(value1: "abc", value2: "abc")
    XCTAssertEqual(container.value1, container.value2)
}
```

Now let's go to work by telling Xcode to run the tests:

## Compiling the shared library
(This section goes into detail about how to triage and resolve each issue I ran into - I'm hoping this is helpful for folks who, like me, weren't experienced at building and linking static libraries. If you're looking for a laundry list of what to do to make it work, skip to [here](/blog/xcode-shared-test-target#tldr).)

### Clean and run #1:

```
Use of unresolved identifier 'assertContainerWorks'
```

Makes sense - now that we have `assertContainerWorks` in a separate library, we need to import the library's Swift module. `import SharedTestUtils` works, so our tests now look like this:

```swift
import XCTest
@testable import ExampleApp
import SharedTestUtils

class ExampleAppTests: XCTestCase {
    func testExample() throws {
        assertContainerWorks()
    }
}
```

### Clean and run #2:

```
No such module 'SharedTestUtils'
```

We haven't told Xcode that our test targets depend on `SharedTestUtils` being built, so it hasn't built it for us. We'll need to add `SharedTestUtils` as a dependency in the Xcode project settings (Build Phrases section) for both test targets:

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-6.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the plus button in the dependencies menu" caption="New Dependency" />
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-7.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'SharedTestUtils' library being selected as a dependency" caption="SharedTestUtils" />
</FlowGrid>

### Clean and run #3:

```
Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exit code
```

This one is a little harder: looking at the build log in the report navigator, we see the real error: `Failed to load module 'XCTest'`.

<CaptionedImage filename="xcodeshared-8.png" max={600} caption="" alt="Xcode build output screen showing the failure message" />

This is because we haven't linked the `SharedTestUtils` library against `XCTest`. We'll need to go to the project settings for `SharedTestUtils`, Build Phases, Link Binary With Libraries and select `XCTest` from the sheet.

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-9.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the plus button in linking menu" caption="Linking Menu" />
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-10.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'XCTest' library being selected for linking" caption="Selecting XCTest" />
</FlowGrid>

### Clean and run #4:

```
No such module 'ExampleApp'
```

We haven't specified that the `ExampleApp` target is a dependency of `SharedTestUtils`, so we'll need to add that via Xcode settings as well.

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-11.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the plus button in the dependencies menu for SharedTestUtils" caption="" />
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-12.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'XCTest' library being selected for linking" caption="" />
</FlowGrid>

### Clean and run #5:

```
Undefined symbol: SharedTestUtils.assertContainerWorks() -> ()
```

We've gotten past the compiler errors and we're now on to linker errors. `SharedTestUtils` got compiled, but our test targets aren't linking against it, so the linker doesn't know where to find the executable code for `assertContainerWorks`. This can be solved in Xcode project settings too - under "Link Binary with Libraries" for both test targets, we'll add `libSharedTestUtils.a`, the static library artifact that results from compiling `SharedTestUtils`.

<FlowGrid columns={2}>
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-13.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the plus button in the linking menu for the test target" caption="Adding a library to link against" />
    <CaptionedImage max={300} filename="xcodeshared-14.png" alt="Xcode menu showing the 'libSharedTestUtils.a' library being selected for linking" caption="libSharedTestUtils.a" />
</FlowGrid>

### Clean and run #6:
It works!

## tl;dr:
In order to create a library that depends on app code and is shared between two test targets, you need to:

1. Create the library as a Static Library target
2. Link the library with XCTest
3. Add your app target as a dependency of the library target
2. Add the library target as a dependency as all test targets and link all test targets with the `.a` binary
3. Import the library into your tests

## Other Options Considered
A static library is only one way to include code in a dependency. I also tried using a Unit Test Bundle, but ran into linker issues - the test targets can't link against `SharedTestUtils` if it's a Unit Test Bundle, or at least not easily - Xcode doesn't show it in the Link Binary With Libraries setting.

Using a dynamic library (wrapped in a Framework target) is also an option, and it might work well if your utils library just needs `XCTest` and doesn't need to `@testable import` your app. However, this is subject to the same issue as a Unit Test Bundle, where you can't link against the app binary. Thanks to [Boris Bügling for pointing out](https://twitter.com/NeoNacho/status/1292203466362773505) that you can get around this with `BUNDLE_LOADER`, but it turns out if you specify the loader app correctly you end up with the following:

```
'-bundle_loader <path/to/ExampleApp> not allowed with '-dynamiclib'
```

Apparently `BUNDLE_LOADER` doesn't work with dynamic libraries, which is why I went with the static library approach in the first place. To be honest, I'm not sure if this is the best way - there could be something I'm totally missing that might allow this to work with a Framework.

## Conclusion
Hopefully this approach helps folks who want to maintain multiple unit test targets while keeping shared app test utils in common between them.
