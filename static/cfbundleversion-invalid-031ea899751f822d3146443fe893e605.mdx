For some reason lately, I've been having a lot of trouble installing apps and running tests in the iOS simulator on Xcode 10 (non-beta). The error message looks like this:

> Failed to install the requested application
> The application's CFBundleVersion is invalid

To be completely honest, I'm not super sure what causes this error, but it might be related to the fact that I'm using non-semver version numbers (they include a sub-patch number) and [the Xcode 11 simulator treats CFBundleVersion numbers differently](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/117322). For what it's worth, this started happening when installing the Xcode 11 beta and running it in parallel with Xcode 10.

Anyways, the magic fix is to kill CoreSimulatorBridge: in 99% of cases, this has fixed the error for me! ðŸŽ‰

```
killall -9 CoreSimulatorBridge
```
