When browsing noahgilmore.com/blog starting today, you may see sponsored sections like this:

<Instabug />

I'll be piloting these sponsored sections on some posts (generally the longer form, higher effort ones) in the coming months. Writing high quality content on this blog takes a fair amount of work - drafting, editing, testing, creating example code, recording gifs, etc. The revenue I get through sponsorships helps make the investment worth it from a financial perspective, and hopefully I'm able to pay it forward by continuing to create content for the community.

In the interest of transparency, I wanted to write this post to detail a couple of points:

1. I'm paid directly per-click for these advertisements, no third parties involved. I negotiate contracts directly. In the future I may look into using indie-focused ad networks, but I'll never compromise reader experience by using Google AdSense, for example.
2. Since there's no ad network, there's no ad targeting.

I'm grateful to Instabug for being the first sponsor of this site. If your company would like to be displayed as a sponsor, feel free to [reach out](mailto:noah@noahgilmore.com).
