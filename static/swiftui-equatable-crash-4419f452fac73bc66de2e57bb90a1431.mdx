> Update (2/23/2020): In addition to the issue this post originally described, I've reported another, similar issue for SwiftUI in AppKit. See the bottom of this post for more info.

> Update (11/14/2020): I've added some more symbols I've seen in crashes with similar causes, which hopefully will be indexed by Google and help developers facing similar issues. My go-to strategy for fixing internal SwiftUI crashes (especially on macOS) has been "Is something not Equatable? Make it Equatable."

I've been working lately on rewriting some of [CIFilter.io](/blog/cifilterio) in SwiftUI. One crash I came across that initially stumped me would happen when resetting my `UIHostingController`'s `rootView` to a view that was equivalent to the one already set (mostly, this happened when transitioning the window from full to split-screen mode). The crash only had one stackframe that started with `AG::LayoutDescriptor::compare`:

```
#0	0x00007fff4a9b6069 in AG::LayoutDescriptor::compare(unsigned char const*, unsigned char const*, unsigned char const*, unsigned long, unsigned int) ()
```

Initially I had no idea what was going on here, but I found two clues. One was this tweet:

<Tweet tweetId="1268846742558179330" />

Looks like [Alexey Demedeckiy](https://medium.com/@DAloG) ran into this a while back, and the solution was to make an enum with many cases conform to `Equatable`. I realized that I also had an enum (`FilterParameterType`) with 20+ cases which I was now using as part of the SwiftUI view state.

The second clue was that the crashing method was called `compare`: my enum wasn't equatable, but it seems like SwiftUI was doing something under the hood to try to compare it anyways.

I spent a bit of time creating a sample project and whitling down my code into a minimal reproduction case, and I realized that the following triggers the same crash:

```swift
enum Type {
    case one(info: String)
    case two(info: String)
    case three(info: String)
    case four(info: String)
    case five(info: String)
    case six(info: String)
    case seven(info: String)
    case eight(info: String)
    case nine(info: String)
    case ten(info: String)
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var type: Type = .one(info: "one")

    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
            Button(action: {
                self.type = .one(info: "one")
            }, label: {
                Text("Tap here to crash")
            })
        }
    }
}
```

Tapping that button (twice, for some reason?) crashes the app!

This was a super, super interesting bug to find. Even more interesting is that the crash _doesn't_ happen if you do any of the following:

1. Make the enum `Equatable`
2. Comment out one of the cases
3. Comment out the _associated value_ of one of the cases

From what I can tell, SwiftUI's trying hard to compare the enum, even if it's not equatable, but I guess 10 cases is the point at which it gives up.

The takeaway: if you use enums as part of your SwiftUI view state, make them Equatable.

## Bonus

About a month after this issue, I noticed another, similar issue. It seems a similar crash can happen in SwiftUI running on top of AppKit (in macOS apps) with the following code:

```swift
struct NormalExperienceState {
    var one: String?
    var two: String?
    var three: String?
    var four: String?
    var five: String?
    var six: String?
    var seven: String?
    var eight: String?
    var nine: String?
    var ten: String?
    var eleven: String?
    var twelve: String?
    var thirteen: String?
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var state = NormalExperienceState()
    var body: some View {
        Text("Hello, world!").padding()
    }
}
```

The crash seems to happen most frequently in `objc_release`, `StateStorageBox`, `swift_initStructMetadata`, or `outlined copy of` various SwiftUI structs. (Putting these keywords here in case someone is googling and needs to find them.) Similarly, making the struct conform correctly to `Equatable` solves the problem.

I've created [another sample project](https://github.com/noahsark769/NGSwiftUIEquatableStateIssue) (with linked feedback number) for this.
