Pop quiz: in a `UIButton`, how do you set a padding of 15pt between the image and the title?

<CaptionedImage filename="uibutton-padding-1.png" alt="Image showing 10pt padding between title and image of a UIButton" caption="If you're looking for a code snippet, skip to the bottom :)" />

I had to do this at work recently, and I was surprised at how hard it was to reason about. After trying to wrap my head around it for half an hour, I realized that it's possible, but takes some trickiness with `contentEdgeInsets`, `titleEdgeInsets`, and `imageEdgeInsets`.
