As iOS developers, many of us have gotten used to the concept of "one app delegate, one window" over the years. For me, this code to initialize a window and make it visible on app launch is second nature at this point:

```swift
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        window = UIWindow(frame: UIScreen.main.bounds)
        window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
        window?.makeKeyAndVisible()
        return true
    }
```

In iOS 13, this system changes a bit. Since iPad apps can have multiple windows running simultaneously, you need a [UIWindowSceneDelegate](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwindowscenedelegate) as well as an app delegate. I'd highly recommend watching ["Introducing Multiple Windows for iPad"](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/212) (WWDC 2019) since there's a lot of good info about the new scene system there.

One thing that most of the WWDC videos that talk about is using a "scene manifest" as part of your Info.plist to configure your scene sessions.
