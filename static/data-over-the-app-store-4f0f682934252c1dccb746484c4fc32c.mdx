import { TrestleBlogPostLink } from "../../components/DataLink";

About a year ago I wrote a puzzle game called <TrestleBlogPostLink>Trestle</TrestleBlogPostLink>. If you download it using <TrestleBlogPostLink>this link</TrestleBlogPostLink> or any of the links in this post (by clicking on them on your iOS device), you'll get a nice Easter egg and two of the (normally paid) level sets enabled for free.

In this post, I'm going to describe the technique behind how I implemented this referral link without a backend or third party service, using `UIPasteboard`.

_Disclaimer: I'm not recommending you use this in production to power your business-critical flows, since it's a non-standard use of an API and a few things could change that would break it. It might be tenable in small use cases, but might also be grounds for App Store rejection. Use at your own risk._

# Background

It's common in iOS development, especially when you have a mobile web version of a product along with an app, to want to take action on first app launch based on how the user was interacting with your product before.

As an example, imagine you're Facebook and the user is viewing a profile in Safari, then decides to download the app - you'd ideally open that profile when the app launches. I like to call this "passing data over the app store", and Apple doesn't provide an official API for it.

There are tricky ways to hack around this restriction - one of the most common is called "fingerprinting", where you use a variety of signals to try to link a user's web session to their app session. With this technique, you collect data about the user's browser (IP address, etc) beforehand, and make a call to your server on app launch to try to give your app data about what flow to present, if any.

This approach is involved and usually implemented by a third party company like [Branch](https://branch.io/), or with your own backend if you're a big enough operation. I'm going to describe a simpler method which requires no backend, using [UIPasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard).

The general approach looks like this:

1. Write a link on your website which, on click, both opens the url and copies it into the pasteboard with data encoded as a url parameter
2. On `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, read the pasteboard, decode the data, and use it to take action

# Copying a link (website)
In javascript (depending on your browser) it's possible to programmatically copy to the clipboard using `document.execCommand("copy")` (see [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand)). The API is a little finnicky - you have to construct a DOM element and fill it with the content you want to copy, and you can only use `input` and `textarea` elements, but it works! I tested this on iOS 11 and 12, but according to [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=clipboard) it looks like it's supported as far back as iOS 10. (Note though - it won't work in the iOS simulator.)

Here's the code to copy a string to the pasteboard (thanks in part to [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34045777/copy-to-clipboard-using-javascript-in-ios)):

```javascript
function iosCopyToClipboard(string) {
    let el = document.createElement("input");
    el.contentEditable = true;
    el.readOnly = false;
    el.value = string;
    el.style = "position: absolute; opacity: 0.0";
    document.body.appendChild(el);

    let range = document.createRange();
    range.selectNodeContents(el);

    var s = window.getSelection();
    s.removeAllRanges();
    s.addRange(range);

    // A big number, to cover anything that could be inside the element.
    el.setSelectionRange(0, 999999);

    return document.execCommand('copy');
}
```

Once we've got this working, it's easy enough to take some data, base64 encode it, and copy it to the clipboard in addition to the link's url parameter (I've called the parameter `ed` for "encoded data"). Note that we include a timestamp of when the link was clicked - we'll need this for later. I'm using React here, but other frameworks or vanilla JS should be similar:

```jsx
class DataLink extends React.Component {
    handleOnClick() {
        let data = {
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            ...this.props.data
        }
        let json = JSON.stringify(data);
        let encoded = btoa(json)
        let toAppend;
        if (this.props.href.includes("?")) {
            toAppend = "&ed=" + encoded
        } else {
            toAppend = "?ed=" + encoded
        }
        iosCopyToClipboard(this.props.href + toAppend);
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <a href={this.props.href} onClick={this.handleOnClick.bind(this)}>{
                this.props.children}
            </a>
        );
    }
};
```

Now, let's construct a link with JSON data that we want to pass to our app:

```jsx
const TrestleBlogPostLink = (props) => {
    let data = {"referrer": "pasteboard-blog-post"};
    return (
        <DataLink
            data={data}
            href={"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trestle-the-new-sudoku/id1300230302?mt=8"}
        >
            {props.children}
        </DataLink>);
};
```

When the user clicks on this link, 

# Reading the link (app)
From the app side, we'll hook into [UIPasteboard](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uipasteboard), a UIKit class which allows your app to integrate with iOS's copy and paste functionality. You can access the current contents of the general pasteboard (the one that gets updated when the user copies and pastes) using `UIPasteboard.general` - `UIPasteboard.general.strings` gives you the current text contents (pasteboard can also hold images, colors, etc).

I decided to encapsulate this functionality into an `AppStoreBridge` class - this class will have the responsibility of checking the pasteboard and reporting to its delegate if it sees a referral link.

```swift
protocol AppStoreBridgeDelegate: class {
    func appStoreBridge(_ bridge: AppStoreBridge, didTriggerCampaignLinkReferrer: String)
}

final class AppStoreBridge {
    static let shared = AppStoreBridge()

    weak var delegate: AppStoreBridgeDelegate?

    func checkForReferralLinks() {
        // Check the UIPasteboard here...
    }
}
```

To fill in the body of `checkForReferralLinks`, let's first define the referral data we're looking for:

```swift
struct ReferralData: Codable {
    let timestamp: TimeInterval
    let referrer: String
}
```

Now we'll iterate through all the strings in the pasteboard, and check them to see the URL we're expecting: 

```swift
let pasteboard = UIPasteboard.general
guard let strings = pasteboard.strings else { return }
for string in strings {
    if string.contains("id1300230302") {
        guard let url = URL(string: string) else { return }
        guard let components = URLComponents(url: url, resolvingAgainstBaseURL: false) else { return }
        guard let queryItems = components.queryItems else { return }
        guard let value = queryItems.filter({ $0.name == "ed" }).first?.value else { return }
        guard let data = Data(base64Encoded: value) else { return }
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        guard let referral = try? decoder.decode(ReferralData.self, from: data) else { return }
        /// Use the referral object...
    }
}
```

Note here that we use a string that we know will be in the URL ("id1300230302") to quickly filter out any other pasteboard items.

Now all that's left is to report the referral! However, we probably only want to take action if the user recently clicked the link - I used a timeout of 5 minutes here:

```swift
let referralClickDate = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: referral.timestamp)
let currentDate = Date()
if currentDate.minutes(from: referralClickDate) < 5 {
    self.delegate?.appStoreBridge(self, didTriggerCampaignLinkReferrer: referral.referrer)
    return
}
```

The small Date extension to make this possible looks like:

```swift
extension Date {
    func minutes(from date: Date) -> Int {
        return Calendar.current.dateComponents([.minute], from: date, to: self).minute ?? 0
    }
}
```

And we're done! Our app store bridge tells the app delegate that it noticed a referral, and we can then take any action we want!

```swift
extension AppDelegate: AppStoreBridgeDelegate {
    func appStoreBridge(_ bridge: AppStoreBridge, didTriggerCampaignLink referrer: String) {
        if referrer == "pasteboard-blog-post" {
            // Show an easter egg, unlock level sets, etc...
        }
    }
}
```
