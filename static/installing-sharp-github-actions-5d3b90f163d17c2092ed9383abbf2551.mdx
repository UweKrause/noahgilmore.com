Something went wrong installing the "sharp" module

Module did not self-register.

- Remove the "node_modules/sharp" directory, run "npm install" and look for errors
- Consult the installation documentation at https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/install/
- Search for this error at https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues
```

Given [how](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/18277) [many](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1899) [different](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/2031) [people](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/952) [have](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1936) [reported](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1983) [symptoms](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/2065) [of](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/1819) what looks like the same issue, I figured I'd shared what worked for my case.

The root cause of this issue seems to be that folks are trying to run `gatsby build` with a version of node which is different than the one they installed `sharp` with. In my case, I used to have the workflow set up do deploy like this:

```yml
- name: Build and Deploy
  uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@db4aacadf4db71778afb0c8a452382184a71d318
    env:
      ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      BRANCH: gh-pages
      FOLDER: public
      BUILD_SCRIPT: npm run gatsby-build
      CNAME: noahgilmore.com
```

[github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) is a great github action that automatically pushes a given local folder to your `gh-pages` branch to deploy via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The version I was using ran everything in a Docker container and excuted the given `BUILD_SCRIPT` before pushing. I think this was the issue - that container most likely had a different version of node.

The most recent release of this action gets rid of the `BUILD_SCRIPT` entirely, opting to let the workflow build its own folder first, and the action _just_ takes care of pushing the build folder. The working workflow looks like this:

```yml
- name: npm run gatsby-build
  run: npm run gatsby-build
- name: Build and Deploy
    uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@releases/v3
    with:
      ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}
      BRANCH: gh-pages
      FOLDER: public
      CNAME: noahgilmore.com
```
