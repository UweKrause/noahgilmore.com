<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorely in need of an editor shortcut that: moves to the next comma after the cursor, deletes a space after it, and inserts a newline in place of the space.

Ideally I&#39;d love an accessibility-based solution so I could use it in Xcode</p>&mdash; Noah Gilmore (@noahsark769) <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1122982688724357120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2019</a></blockquote>
