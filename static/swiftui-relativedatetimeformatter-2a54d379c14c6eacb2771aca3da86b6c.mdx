In the wild world of 2019 SwiftUI development, lots of things aren't documented. One such thing I ran into recently was the usage of `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` in a `Text` view.

`RelativeDateTimeFormatter` is a new formatter which is available in iOS 13+ and macOS 10.15+. Though it's [not documented at the time of writing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/relativedatetimeformatter) (just like [14.6% of Foundation](https://nooverviewavailable.com/foundation/)), there have been a [fair](https://nshipster.com/formatter/#relativedatetimeformatter) [amount](https://david.y4ng.fr/relativedatetimeformatter-and-listformatter/) of folks online writing about it. This formatter formats dates relative each other as well as relative `DateComponents` - its output looks like "one minute ago" or "two minutes from now".

Most blog posts about `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` show its usage like this:

```
let formatter = RelativeDateTimeFormatter()
formatter.localizedString(from: DateComponents(day: -1)) // "1 day ago"
```

# SwiftUI, date formatters, and string interpolation
SwiftUI declares a custom string interpolation ([which is a new feature in Swift 5](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/163/how-to-use-custom-string-interpolation-in-swift)) called `LocalizedStringKey.StringInterpolation` (also [undocumented at the time of writing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/localizedstringkey/stringinterpolation), like [59.4% of SwiftUI](https://nooverviewavailable.com/swiftui/)) which allows you to write `Text` views with formatters like so:

```
Text("My String \(myVariable, formatter: myFormatter)")
```

Fair enough, I thought - 

Let's assume I want to show the relative time from the [Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) until now. I'll just write a `Text` the same way, right?

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    static let formatter = RelativeDateTimeFormatter()

    var body: some View {
        let unixEpoch = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
        let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents(
            [.day, .year, .month, .minute, .second],
            from: Date(),
            to: unixEpoch
        )
        return VStack {
            Text("Current date is:")
            Text("\(components, formatter: Self.formatter)").bold()
            Text("since the unix Epoch")
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work: the middle text doesn't show up:

<CaptionedImage filename="relativedatetime-1.png" alt="Screenshot of the app showing no content in the second Text view" caption="Interesting" />

There's also an error in the console!

```
The supplied formatter <NSRelativeDateTimeFormatter: 0x6000025c7c00>
returned `nil` when invoked with <NSDateComponents: 0x6000026b4450> {
    Calendar Year: -49
    Month: -9
    Day: -18
    Minute: -1017
    Second: -43. An empty string will be used instead.
```

# The Tricky Part
As far as I can tell, the reason this happens is because `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` has a few different methods, with different signatures, for formatting its relative dates:

```
func localizedString(for: Date, relativeTo: Date) -> String
func localizedString(from: DateComponents) -> String
func localizedString(fromTimeInterval: TimeInterval) -> String
func string(for: Any?) -> String?
```

However, only one of those matches the [Formatter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/formatter) superclass definition that SwiftUI's string interpolation uses. I'm guessing that `RelativeDateTimeFormatter`'s `string(for:)` method doesn't call into the same code that `localizedString(from:)` uses.

Hopefully this changes in a future version of iOS, but for now, we can solve the problem in a couple of ways: 

## Solution #1
Since we need the date relative to right now, we can take advantage of the fact that that's the default behavior of `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` and just pass in `epochTime`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    static let formatter = RelativeDateTimeFormatter()

    var body: some View {
        let unixEpoch = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
        return VStack {
            Text("Current date is:")
            Text("\(unixEpoch, formatter: Self.formatter)").bold()
            Text("since the unix Epoch")
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

This gets us the result we want:

<CaptionedImage filename="relativedatetime-2.png" alt="Screenshot of the app showing the correct relative time" caption="Note: if you want minutes, seconds, etc, set the formatter's dateTimeStyle and unitStyle" />

## Solution #2
We can also ignore the string interpolation entirely, and just call the formatter's `localizedString`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    static let formatter = RelativeDateTimeFormatter()

    var body: some View {
        let unixEpoch = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
        let components = Calendar.current.dateComponents(
            [.day, .year, .month, .minute, .second],
            from: Date(),
            to: unixEpoch
        )
        return VStack {
            Text("Current date is:")
            Text("\(Self.formatter.localizedString(from: components))").bold()
            Text("since the unix Epoch")
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

<CaptionedImage filename="relativedatetime-2.png" alt="Screenshot of the app showing the correct relative time" caption="ðŸŽ‰" />

# Conclusion
Either of the solutions above would work for this specific issue, though if you want to output the relative time between two dates (instead of between one date and now) with the `formatter:` string interpolation, looks like you're out of luck.
