While building this site in Gatsby using [MDX](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx), I noticed that there wasn't any documentation on how to include data from the frontmatter of an MDX document in the document's page layout.

Though this isn't anywhere in the `gatsby-mdx` docs (that I can tell), there's an [example](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx/blob/ee4b17f814396ea7c4aaf8007a1603a57967a40a/examples/kitchen-sink/src/pages/using-pagecontext-frontmatter.mdx) of how to use it in the repo. Frontmatter is passed to the layout component in `props.pageContext.frontmatter`. This means you can do things like this in your markdown document:

```
---
title: My Page
---
This is the content
```

And in your layout component, you can grab the frontmatter:
```jsx
const MyPageLayout = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>
            <div>
                {props.children}
            </div>
        </div>
    ); 
};
```

On this [blog's home page](https://noahgilmore.com/blog) I use frontmatter of all the MDX documents, which includes things like title, date, and preview text, to render the list of blog post previews.
