I [wrote previously](/blog/dark-mode-uicolor-compatibility) about a technique I use in [Trestle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trestle-the-new-sudoku/id1300230302?mt=8) and [CIFilter.io](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cifilter-io/id1457458557?mt=8) to support iOS 12 and lower while still using system provided, dark-mode accessible colors.

Since I wrote that post, I've had a few people comment that the `ColorCompatibility` code had issues, and I've updated it a few times, so today I decided to pull it out into its own library and GitHub repo! ðŸŽ‰

- You can find the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/noahsark769/ColorCompatibility)
- You can install the library via Cocoapods using:
    ```ruby
    pod 'ColorCompatibility', '~> 1.0.0'
    ```

Hopefully this is a better home for the code. Please feel free to submit an issue or pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/noahsark769/ColorCompatibility) if you notice something that you think should be changed.

Thanks to everyone who called out that there were errors in the original blog post - I really appreciate everyone in the community working to make the project more robust. ðŸ’ª
